Provides two convenient functions which requires clipboard compatibility from the utils package, i.e. windows.

- 1) When using file_choose(), the path of the selected file is automatically copied to the clipboard. 
- 2) If you have a column of strings and want to turn those into an R-vector, simply copy the column into the clipboard, run a function, and paste the clipboard.
